# MQTT Panel Broker

This repository is part of a two-repository project that provides an easy-to-use panel for managing information 
processed by an MQTT broker. This repository, **MQTT Panel Broker**, focuses on setting up the broker functionality, 
with MQTT business logic handled via the [Mochi MQTT library](https://github.com/mochi-mqtt/server). The **MQTT
Panel** in the companion repository serves as the control panel, allowing users to view, manage, and control the flow 
of MQTT information in real time.

## Project Overview

The **MQTT Panel Broker** is written in Golang and uses the [Mochi MQTT](https://github.com/mochi-mqtt/server) library
to handle all core MQTT operations. It leverages Mochiâ€™s hooks for data collection on each action performed by the 
broker, such as connection, subscription, publishing, and disconnection events.

An authentication layer, implemented through hooks on top of Mochi, is also integrated into this broker. This layer 
authenticates incoming client connections via an API from the **MQTT Panel** repository, ensuring that only authorized
clients can connect and interact with the broker.

Below is a sequence diagram detailing the flow of each action (connect, subscribe, publish, unsubscribe and disconnect).
In the diagram, it also is described when/how authentication and authorization are handled.

## Features

- **Easy Integration with Control Panel**: Works in tandem with the **MQTT Panel** control interface to provide real-time data management and user-friendly controls.
- **Customizable Hook-Based System**: Uses Mochi's hook-based architecture to allow fine-grained data collection and action handling.
- **Authentication Layer**: Ensures secure client access by authenticating new connections through the API provided by the **MQTT Panel**.
- **Efficient MQTT Operations**: Mochi MQTT library provides efficient and robust MQTT business logic.

## Installation

   go mod tidy
   ```
3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   go build -o mqtt-panel-broker
   ```
   
## Usage
Run the broker executable to start the MQTT broker:
```bash
./mqtt-panel-broker
